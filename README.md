### Hello! I'm Connie. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a front end software engineer who loves to create with beauty and function in mind. I am a professional musician, I sew and make my own clothes because I long for a sustainable future of slow fashion and reduced waste living, and I've recently discovered a love for coding!
